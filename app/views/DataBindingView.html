<div> <h3><b>$injector</b></h3>
    <p>
        Angular uses the value of the ng-app directive to configure the $injector service .
        The $injector is responsible for handling all instantiations of our Angular components, including our app modules, directives, controllers, etc.

        Behind the scenes, the Angular process looks like:

        1. Load the app with the injector -
        var injector = angular.injector(['ng', 'myApp']);
        2. Load the $controller service with the injector -
        var $controller = injector.get('$controller');
        var scope = injector.get('$rootScope').$new();
        3. Load the controller, passing in a scope which is how angular does it at runtime -
        var MyController = $controller('MyController', {$scope: scope}) ;
    </p>

<div> <h3><b>$compile</b></h3>
    <p>
        The $compile service traverses the DOM and collects all of the directives that it finds.
        It then combines all of their linking functions into a single linking function.
        This linking function is then used to link the compiled template to the $rootScope (the scope attached to the ng-app DOM element).
        It finds the directives in the DOM by looking through the attributes, comments, classes, and the DOM element name.
        The $compile service walks the DOM tree looking for DOM elements with directives declared on them.
        When it encounters a DOM element with one or more directives,
        it orders the directives (based upon their priority),
        then uses the $injector service to find and collect the directiveâ€™s compile function and execute it.
    </p>

<div><h3><b>$apply</b></h3>
    <p>
        $scope.$apply() takes a function or an Angular expression string, and executes it, then calls $scope.$digest() to update any bindings or watchers.
        As a result of this, a digest cycle starts at the $rootScope, and subsequently visits all the child scopes calling the watchers along the way.
